# CS520 Grad Intro to Artificial Intelligence
 Projects completed during the Fall 2022 Semester at Rutgers University
 * All projects contain their relative reports which provide explaination of their functions and data collected
   * The first project explores path-finding algorithms in changing environments
     * [Project 1 Write-Up PDF](https://github.com/Neustater/CS-520-Repo/blob/main/Project-1-Maze-Pathfinding/Project%201%20Report.pdf)
   * The second explores potential algorithms for balancing survivability vs reward in probabilistic environments
     * [Project 2 Write-Up PDF](https://github.com/Neustater/CS-520-Repo/blob/main/Project-2-Survival-Transition-Probabilities/Project%202%20Report.pdf)
   * The third builds upon the second by building an Infinite Time Horizon MDP to perform the best possible action given any situation in that environment and creating a neural network which trained on that MDP to create an accurate prediction with a smaller size complexity
     * [Project 3 Write-Up PDF](https://github.com/Neustater/CS-520-Repo/blob/main/Project-3-Survival-Neural-Network-MDP-Infinite-Horizon/Project%203%20Report.pdf)
 * Due to the nature of these projects, many take very long times (several hours or more) to run on normal hardware and were run on servers provided by the school
 
 If you are currently enrolled in this course with Professor Cowan and are considering "borrowing" this code **DONT**, as he said in class, you will regret it. He is kind and will help you please go to him for help.
